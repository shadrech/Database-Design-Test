//do other stuff with Javascript
//small app so can get away with visiting server for every database
//transaction. However in large app would make sense to use ajax to
//make calls to server and updating state after call returns http
//status code 200. Can be achieved with jQuery, or more complex setup
//with React.js and axios for ajax calls...
